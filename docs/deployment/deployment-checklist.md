## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### 1. **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Create production environment file
cp env.example .env.production

# Set required environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
REDIS_URL=redis://host:6379
S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-s3-endpoint
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@your-domain.com
```

### 2. **Database Migration**
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Push schema to database
npm run db:push
```

### 3. **Build and Deploy**
```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### 4. **Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/healthz

# Check database connection
docker-compose exec web npm run db:generate

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 🔍 **Testing Checklist**

### ✅ **Pre-Deployment Tests**
- [ ] **Unit Tests** - Run `npm test`
- [ ] **Type Checking** - Run `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] **Linting** - Run `npm run lint`
- [ ] **Build Test** - Run `npm run build`
- [ ] **Database Migration** - Test schema push
- [ ] **Docker Build** - Test container builds

### ✅ **Post-Deployment Tests**
- [ ] **Health Check** - Verify `/api/healthz` endpoint
- [ ] **Authentication** - Test login flow
- [ ] **File Upload** - Test file upload functionality
- [ ] **Duplicate Detection** - Test duplicate finding
- [ ] **Cloud Integration** - Test rclone connection
- [ ] **Dashboard** - Verify statistics display
- [ ] **Background Jobs** - Test job processing

## 🚨 **Known Limitations**

### **Temporarily Disabled Features**
- **ML Embeddings** - Advanced similarity detection
- **Interactive Charts** - Recharts visualization
- **ML Model Analytics** - Model usage statistics

### **Future Enhancements**
- **ML Integration** - Add back ML features after initial deployment
- **Advanced Analytics** - Add interactive charts
- **Performance Optimization** - Add caching and optimization
